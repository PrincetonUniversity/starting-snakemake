# Starting Snakemake

The workshop slides are available here:  [Supercharge Your Analyses with Snakemake](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11zLDHJCo-uzm7rmrxpHZJNgTg9Zss_rsuWbO1lkb_EI/edit?usp=sharing)

This repository provides a simple multi-folder tutorial:
1. **01_jupyter** – Jupyter-based example that fetches Wikipedia data and plots a histogram.
2. **02_simple_snakemake** – Minimal Snakefile demonstrating a single rule.
3. **03_final_snakemake** – More complex pipeline that processes multiple links and combines results.
